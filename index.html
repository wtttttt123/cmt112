What ever man might build could never express or reflect more than he was. He could record neither more nor less than he had learned of life when the buildings were built. Lack of culture means what it has always meant: ignoble civilization and therefore imminent downfall.Organic buildings are the strength and lightness of the spiders' spinning, buildings qualified by light, bred by native character to environment, married to the ground."
